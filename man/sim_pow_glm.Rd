\arguments{
\item{fixed}{One sided formula for fixed effects in the simulation. 
To suppress intercept add -1 to formula.}

\item{random}{One sided formula for random effects in the simulation. 
Must be a subset of fixed.}

\item{random3}{One sided formula for random effects at third level in the 
simulation. Must be a subset of fixed(and likely of random).}

\item{fixed_param}{Fixed effect parameter values (i.e. beta weights). 
Must be same length as fixed.}

\item{random_param}{A list of named elements that must contain: 
\itemize{
   \item  random_var: variance of random parameters,
   \item  rand_gen: Name of simulation function for random effects.
}
       Optional elements are:
\itemize{
   \item ther: Theorectial mean and variance from rand_gen,
   \item ther_sim: Simulate mean/variance for standardization purposes,
   \item cor_vars: Correlation between random effects,
   \item ...: Additional parameters needed for rand_gen function.
 }}

\item{random_param3}{A list of named elements that must contain: 
\itemize{
    \item random_var: variance of random parameters,
    \item rand_gen: Name of simulation function for random effects.
}
      Optional elements are:
\itemize{
    \item ther: Theorectial mean and variance from rand_gen,
    \item ther_sim: Simulate mean/variance for standardization purposes,
    \item cor_vars: Correlation between random effects,
    \item ...: Additional parameters needed for rand_gen function.
}}

\item{cov_param}{List of arguments to pass to the continuous generating 
 function. Required arguments include:
 \itemize{
   \item dist_fun: This is a quoted R distribution function.
   \item var_type: This is the level of variable to generate. Must be 
     either 'single', 'level1', 'level2', or 'level3'. 
     Must be same order as fixed formula above.
 }
 Optional arguments to the distribution functions are in a nested list,
  see the examples for example code for this.
Does not include intercept, time, factors, or interactions.}

\item{k}{Number of third level clusters.}

\item{n}{Cluster sample size.}

\item{p}{Within cluster sample size.}

\item{data_str}{Type of data. Must be "cross", "long", or "single".}

\item{cor_vars}{A vector of correlations between variables.}

\item{fact_vars}{A nested list of factor, categorical, or ordinal variable 
   specification, each list must include:
\itemize{
     \item numlevels = Number of levels for ordinal or factor variables.
     \item var_type = Must be 'single', 'level1', 'level2', or 'level3'.
 }
 Optional arguments include:
 \itemize{
     \item replace
     \item prob
     \item value.labels
 }
  See also \code{\link{sample}} for use of these optional arguments.}

\item{unbal}{A named TRUE/FALSE list specifying whether unbalanced simulation 
design is desired. The named elements must be: "level2" or "level3" representing
unbalanced simulation for level two and three respectively. Default is FALSE,
indicating balanced sample sizes at both levels.}

\item{unbal_design}{When unbal = TRUE, this specifies the design for unbalanced
simulation in one of two ways. It can represent the minimum and maximum 
sample size within a cluster via a named list. This will be drawn from a 
random uniform distribution with min and max specified. 
Secondly, the actual sample sizes within each cluster
can be specified. This takes the form of a vector that must have the same length 
as the level two or three sample size. These are specified as a named list in which
level two sample size is controlled via "level2" and level three sample size is 
controlled via "level3".}

\item{missing}{TRUE/FALSE flag indicating whether missing data should be 
simulated.}

\item{missing_args}{Additional missing arguments to pass to the missing_data 
function. See \code{\link{missing_data}} for examples.}

\item{pow_param}{Number of parameter to calculate power includes intercept 
where applicable.}

\item{alpha}{What should the per test alpha rate be used for the hypothesis 
testing.}

\item{pow_dist}{Which distribution should be used when testing hypothesis 
test, z or t?}

\item{pow_tail}{One-tailed or two-tailed test?}

\item{replicates}{How many replications should be done (i.e. the denominator 
in power calculation).}

\item{terms_vary}{A named list of terms that should vary as a function for 
the power simulation. The names must match arguments to the simulation 
function, see \code{\link{sim_glm}} for examples. Values specified here 
should not be included as arguments in the function call.}

\item{raw_power}{TRUE/FALSE indicating whether raw power output should be 
returned. Default is TRUE, which will create a new nested column with 
raw data by variable(s) manipulated in power analysis.}

\item{glm_fit_mod}{Valid glm syntax to be used for model fitting.}

\item{lme4_fit_mod}{Valid lme4 syntax to be used for model fitting.}

\item{glm_fit_family}{Valid family syntax to pass to the glm function.}

\item{lme4_fit_family}{Valid lme4 family specification passed to glmer.}

\item{...}{Current not used.}

\description{
Input simulation conditions, returns power for term.
}
\details{
This function is a wrapper that replicates the simulation functions for 
simple generalized regression and the generalized linear mixed model power 
functions. This function replicates the power call a specified number of 
times and prints outs a matrix with the results.
